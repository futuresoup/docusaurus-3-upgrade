There's nothing like getting people together who share a common purpose to save humanity.

This guide will help you host events on a scale of easy happy hours to a full on festival.

## We will cover:

1. Event formats

2. Fundraising, logistics, and promotion

3. Free assets you can borrow

## Real Quick

Check to see if there are existing events and organizations you are not aware of.

- [MCJ Events Calendar on Luma](https://lu.ma/u/mcj)
- Local channels in various [Slack Communities](/level-1#core-communities), for example `#meet-seattle` in the [Work on Climate Slack](https://workonclimate.org)
- General climate change meetups - 350.org chapter, green drinks, etc.
- You can also search through Eventbrite, Meetup.com, Luma, and other sites for things about climate change
