## Overview

Heat pumps are a great technology to help us get off of air conditioners, which are a huge portion of greenhouse gas emissions.

They extract heat from the air and transfer itâ€”from indoors out for cooling, or from outdoors in for heating.

Companies and organizations actively engaged in developing high-efficiency heat pumps include Daikin, LG, Carrier, and the U.S. Department of Energy. 

## Progress Made

Advancements in high-efficiency heat pumps include:
- **Variable-speed compressors**: Enhancing control over heating and cooling.
- **Energy management systems**: Optimizing energy consumption.
- **Intelligent controls**: Enabling demand response and building automation.

Leading entities contributing to progress are the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21), ClimateWorks Foundation, and Rocky Mountain Institute.

## Lessons Learned

Key lessons from high-efficiency heat pump development:
1. **Continuous refinement**: Ongoing research is essential to unlock the technology's full potential.
2. **Learning from successes and failures**: Previous implementations inform better future strategies.
3. **Comprehensive solutions**: High-efficiency heat pumps are part of a larger climate change mitigation strategy.

## Challenges Ahead

Critical challenges faced by high-efficiency heat pump development include:
1. **Enhancing efficiency**: Overcoming Coefficient of Performance (COP) barriers.
2. **Scaling production**: Meeting rising global demand requires increased manufacturing capacity.
3. **Cost reduction**: Achieving economies of scale for wider adoption.

Entities actively addressing these challenges include the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), European Heat Pump Association (EHPA), and ClimateWorks Foundation.

## Best Path Forward

To effectively drive high-efficiency heat pumps' deployment for climate change mitigation:
- **Continuous R&D**: Focus on refining technology for maximum efficiency and affordability.
- **Public Awareness**: Educate the public about the benefits of high-efficiency heat pumps.

Leading contributors in this effort include the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21), and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves.
